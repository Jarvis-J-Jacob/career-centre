# Live submission status

Checked on 15 July 2026 after beta.4 publication and the automation-handoff remediation.

## OpenAI

- Career Centre version **4.0.0-beta.4** is **Published** in the OpenAI Platform portal and visible through the existing ChatGPT Plugins directory link.
- The beta.4 portal submission passed skill validation, was approved immediately, and was explicitly published on 15 July 2026. The previous beta.3 and beta.2 versions now remain approved as superseded versions.
- The signed-in OpenAI Platform organization settings previously showed verification as **Verified**.
- The selected organization is **Amit Sharma**. People & Permissions confirms Amit Sharma is the **Owner** and the organization is the default organization.
- OpenAI's submission documentation states that organization owners automatically have both `api.apps.write` and `api.apps.read`; creation of the real draft functionally confirms write access.
- **Create plugin → Skills only** is the correct package route.
- The final package passes both 56-test suites, submission-ready repository validation, skill quick-validation and the current plugin-creator validator.
- A dedicated portal archive now places `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` at ZIP root while retaining the normal folder-prefixed marketplace archive. Both layouts were tested.
- Client-side validation is working: an intentionally incomplete control returns precise missing-icon errors and a 24×24 SVG returns the precise 48×48 minimum-dimension error.
- Historical clean-preflight attempts with both the full bundle and a four-file OpenAI-scaffolded control returned only `Plugin upload failed`, while the portal logged missing `org_id` scoping.
- After the authenticated Help Center/support flow and a fresh Platform session, the unchanged production archive uploaded successfully and created a real **Career Centre** draft. This resolves the upload blocker without weakening the package.
- The published beta.4 listing contains the three prompts, validated `career-centre` skill, Open Door directory/composer imagery, required scheduling handoff and public subtitle `Find roles. Build better CVs.`.
- The beta.4 ChatGPT and Claude packages each pass 68 tests plus submission-ready repository validation. The OpenAI upload archive is `release/career-centre-4.0.0-beta.4-submission-openai-upload.zip`.
- No OpenAI upload, approval, identity or publication blocker remains. Directory clients may still cache the earlier icon or version briefly.

## Anthropic

- The beta.4 public-directory resubmission was sent through the signed-in Claude Platform form on 15 July 2026 after the automation-handoff fix was merged to `main`. The portal confirmed: **Plugin submitted for review**.
- The submitted source is `https://github.com/HopLittleBunny/career-centre`, path `plugins/claude-career-centre`, with Claude Code and Claude Cowork selected.
- The exact Claude beta.2 ZIP was replacement-uploaded on Max web and showed `Career Centre is installed and ready to use` with `Last updated: Just now`.
- A fresh ordinary chat passed natural auto-routing, synthetic CV diagnosis, compact follow-up questions, explicit setup-only/no-search/no-files restraint, the exact seven-line readiness receipt, advanced field preferences and a 390 px mobile check.
- The signed-in Claude Platform directory form is reachable and explicitly targets Claude Code and Claude Cowork.
- The submission contains the repository, plugin subdirectory, homepage, description, examples, Apache-2.0 licence, privacy URL and account contact email.
- Directory review outcome is pending unless Anthropic reports otherwise.
- The plugin remains installable for normal Claude web chat through the GitHub marketplace `HopLittleBunny/career-centre` and the validated beta.4 ZIP.
- The beta.4 directory submission now advertises the Cowork `/schedule` handoff and application-pack recovery gate; approval and directory availability must not be claimed until Anthropic confirms them.

These access gates do not change the product packages, public repository, marketplace manifest, website or direct-install availability.
